The perfect imperfect dialog box for confirming user actions!

## The Pitch

You know those confirmation modals that ask you to copy a line of text or to repeat a phrase before you are allowed to perform a critical action? Here at this repo, we've taken note of how users feel about this interaction, and elevated this idea to a higher level.

With this modal, you'll be sure to keep users attention for days!

## Functionality

As a user enters text to match the prompt, and thus unlock the confirmatin button, the prompt will extend itself so that it is always slightly ahead of user input. Any advances made in drawing/forcing user attention are also of benefit.

## Features

### Extended Prompt

With a text prompt that continually grows as users copy text, the fun never ends!

## Future Roadmap

### Combo Mode!

Flashing lights, counter and a 'personal best' record are sure to keep users engaged and excited!

## Closing Notes

_Formerly named `bad-confirmation-modal`, renamed to convey this demo's purpose better and soften negative connotations_
